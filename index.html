            <h1>Catcher, 1st and 2nd Base</h1>
            <p>
              Yadier is a kid who loves baseball. Since he was 4years old, he
              would play catch with his dad. Now as a 9 year old he loves to
              play with his team mates. He plays different positions. His main
              position is catcher, but he also plays 1st, shortstop and 2nd
              base.

                <h4>First Base</h4>
                <p>
                  First base is a crucial position in baseball. It requires
                  quick reflexes and good hand-eye coordination to catch throws
                  from infielders and cover the base efficiently. Players at
                  first base should also be ready to make split-second decisions
                  to tag the base or make a play on a runner.

                <p>
                  First base was his first position when he was 5 years old in
                  rec team. Due to his strong arms and tall built, he can reach
                  3rd base with ease.

                <h4>Catcher</h4>
                <p>
                  Catcher is a pivotal position in baseball. Catchers need to be
                  not only skilled at receiving pitches and framing strikes but
                  also adept at throwing out baserunners attempting to steal.
                  Their leadership on the field, ability to communicate with
                  pitchers, and resilience in blocking pitches make them
                  indispensable assets to the team's defense.

                <h4>2nd Base</h4>
                <p>
                  Second base is a critical position in baseball. Players at
                  second base need to possess quick reflexes and strong fielding
                  abilities to turn double plays and cover the base effectively.
                  Additionally, their ability to read the game and anticipate
                  plays helps maintain the team's defensive integrity up the
                  middle of the field.
