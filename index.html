                <h4>First Base</h4>
                <p>
                  First base is a crucial position in baseball. It requires
                  quick reflexes and good hand-eye coordination to catch throws
                  from infielders and cover the base efficiently. Players at
                  first base should also be ready to make split-second decisions
                  to tag the base or make a play on a runner.
                </p>
                <h5>What I like about it</h5>
                <p>
                  First base was his first position when he was 5 years old in
                  rec team. Due to his strong arms and tall built, he can reach
                  3rd base with ease.

                <h4>Catcher</h4>
                <p>
                  Catcher is a pivotal position in baseball. Catchers need to be
                  not only skilled at receiving pitches and framing strikes but
                  also adept at throwing out baserunners attempting to steal.
                  Their leadership on the field, ability to communicate with
                  pitchers, and resilience in blocking pitches make them
                  indispensable assets to the team's defense.

                <h4>Shortstop</h4>
                <p>
                  Shortstop is a dynamic position in baseball, ideal for agile
                  players. Positioned between second and third base, the
                  shortstop must have excellent fielding skills to scoop up
                  ground balls and a strong throwing arm to make accurate plays.
                  Quick thinking and communication with teammates are key for
                  the shortstop to coordinate infield defense effectively.
